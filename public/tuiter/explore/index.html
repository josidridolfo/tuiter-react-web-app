Background color is black.
Borders are rgb(47, 51, 54).
All classes must be prefixed with "wd-".
All content below is offset 16px from the left border.
The letters A, B, C, etc. are used to reference different parts of the wireframe and don't need to be implemented;
only the content they refer to.
The wireframe shows at least one example of different types of posts labeled C, D, and E.
For this assignment, create at least 2 examples of each.
Grab dummy content from https://www.lipsum.com/, from real posts and articles, or create your own content.
